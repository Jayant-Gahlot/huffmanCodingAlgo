# huffmanCodingAlgo
Huffman Coding is a popular lossless data compression algorithm. It assigns variable-length codes to input characters, with shorter codes for more frequent characters and longer codes for less frequent ones. This approach minimizes the overall storage space required to encode a set of data.
